# The directory for raw data

If you are working in *qilin*, you are strongly recommended to create a symbolic link from Jyun-Yu's directory to save the disk usage.

## Example

```bash
ln -s /home/jyunyu/17s_cs249/raw/stackoverflow
```

## Please do not commit anything raw data to the repository

They are too large to fit in the server.
